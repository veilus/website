You've written a perfect scraper. It works beautifully on the first 10 requests. By request 100, you're getting CAPTCHAs. By request 500, you're IP-banned. Sound familiar?

This guide covers everything we've learned about scraping at scale without getting blocked.

## How Websites Detect Scrapers

Before discussing solutions, you need to understand the detection stack. Modern anti-bot systems use layered detection:

### Layer 1: Rate Limiting

The simplest defense. If you make 100 requests per second from one IP, you're obviously not human. Rate limits are typically:

- **Aggressive:** 30-60 requests/minute (Google, Amazon)
- **Moderate:** 120-300 requests/minute (most e-commerce)
- **Relaxed:** 600+ requests/minute (static content sites)

### Layer 2: IP Reputation

Anti-bot services maintain databases of "known bad" IPs. Datacenter IPs (AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean) are flagged immediately. Residential IPs are trusted by default.

| IP Type | Trust Level | Cost | Speed |
|---------|-----------|------|-------|
| Datacenter | ❌ Low | $2/month | Fast |
| Residential | ✅ High | $5-15/GB | Variable |
| Mobile | ✅ Very High | $15-30/GB | Slow |
| ISP (Static Residential) | ✅ High | $3-8/IP/month | Fast |

### Layer 3: Browser Fingerprinting

This is where most scrapers fail. Even with rotating IPs and realistic headers, websites can detect automation through:

- **Navigator properties** — Headless Chrome has telltale differences (`navigator.webdriver = true`)
- **Canvas/WebGL rendering** — Identical fingerprints across requests = detected
- **JavaScript execution** — Bots don't scroll, don't move the mouse, don't trigger hover events
- **TLS fingerprint (JA3/JA4)** — The SSL handshake itself reveals the client type
- **HTTP/2 fingerprint** — Frame ordering and settings differ between real browsers and HTTP libraries

### Layer 4: Behavioral Analysis

The most sophisticated layer. AI models analyze:

- Click patterns (too regular = bot)
- Page navigation flow (going directly to product pages without browsing = suspicious)
- Session duration (too short or too long)
- Interaction timing (humans have natural variance; bots don't)

## The Anti-Bot Ecosystem

| Service | Used By | Detection Level |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Cloudflare** | ~20% of websites | Medium-High |
| **Akamai Bot Manager** | Enterprise sites | High |
| **PerimeterX (HUMAN)** | E-commerce | Very High |
| **DataDome** | Luxury/ticketing | Very High |
| **reCAPTCHA v3** | Widespread | Medium |
| **hCaptcha** | Privacy-focused sites | Medium |

## Proven Techniques for Unblocked Scraping

### 1. Use Real Browsers, Not HTTP Libraries

The single most impactful change you can make. Tools like `requests` (Python) or `axios` (Node.js) send HTTP requests that look nothing like a real browser.

**Instead, use:**
- **Playwright** — Microsoft's browser automation library
- **Puppeteer** — Google's Chrome automation
- **Veilus + VeilusFlow** — Record your scraping workflow visually, export to Playwright

```javascript
// Bad: HTTP library (easily detected)
const response = await fetch('https://target.com/products');

// Good: Real browser (much harder to detect)
const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('https://target.com/products');
const data = await page.content();
```

### 2. Rotate Fingerprints, Not Just IPs

Most scrapers rotate proxies but use the same browser fingerprint for every request. This is like wearing the same unique outfit to every store while changing your car — the stores still recognize you.

**Each scraping session needs:**
- A unique canvas fingerprint
- Matching WebGL parameters
- Consistent navigator properties (don't mix Windows UA with Mac fonts)
- Realistic screen resolution for the supposed device

This is exactly what anti-detect browsers like Veilus do — each profile gets a unique, internally consistent fingerprint.

### 3. Residential Proxies are Non-Negotiable

For any site with serious anti-bot protection, datacenter IPs are immediately flagged. You need residential proxies.

**Recommended providers:**
- **Bright Data** — Largest network, most reliable, expensive
- **Smartproxy** — Good balance of quality and price
- **IPRoyal** — Budget-friendly residential
- **Oxylabs** — Enterprise-grade

**Pro tip:** Use **sticky sessions** (same IP for the entire browsing session) rather than rotating on every request. Real users don't change IP every 30 seconds.

### 4. Mimic Human Behavior

```javascript
// Bad: Robot-like precision
await page.click('#add-to-cart');
await page.click('#checkout');

// Good: Human-like behavior
await page.mouse.move(randomX(), randomY()); // random movement
await sleep(random(500, 1500)); // natural pause
await page.click('#add-to-cart');
await sleep(random(2000, 4000)); // "thinking" time
await page.scroll(0, random(200, 400)); // scroll like a human
await page.click('#checkout');
```

Key behaviors to simulate:
- **Random delays** between actions (800ms-3s for clicks, 2-5s between page loads)
- **Mouse movement** before clicking (humans don't teleport the cursor)
- **Scrolling** through content (don't jump directly to the target element)
- **Page dwell time** (spend 10-30 seconds per page, not 0.5 seconds)

### 5. Manage Cookies and Sessions

Anti-bot systems track session behavior. A session that:
- Has no cookies → suspicious (everyone has cookies)
- Ignores Set-Cookie headers → definitely a bot
- Never accesses CSS/JS resources → headless browser detection

**Solution:** Use a real browser profile that maintains cookies, localStorage, and cache across sessions. Anti-detect browsers do this automatically.

### 6. Handle CAPTCHAs Gracefully

When you do encounter CAPTCHAs:

1. **Slow down** — CAPTCHAs often mean you've triggered a threshold
2. **Switch fingerprint + IP** — The current identity is flagged
3. **Use solving services** as a last resort (2Captcha, Anti-Captcha)
4. **Wait and retry** — Some CAPTCHAs are temporary rate-limit responses

## Architecture for Scale

For serious scraping operations (10,000+ pages/day):

```
                    ┌─── Profile 1 (Fingerprint A + Proxy A)
                    │
Job Queue ──────────┼─── Profile 2 (Fingerprint B + Proxy B)
(URLs to scrape)    │
                    ├─── Profile 3 (Fingerprint C + Proxy C)
                    │
                    └─── Profile N (Fingerprint N + Proxy N)
                              │
                              ▼
                        Data Pipeline
                    (clean → store → export)
```

**Key principles:**
- **Pool management** — Rotate profiles after N requests or M minutes
- **Error handling** — If a profile gets CAPTCHAs, retire it and use a fresh one
- **Rate limiting** — Self-impose limits (1-3 requests/minute per profile is safe for most sites)
- **Retry logic** — Exponential backoff on failures

## Tools We Recommend

| Tool | Use Case | Price |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Veilus** | Multi-profile management + automation | Free (5 profiles) |
| **Playwright** | Browser automation scripting | Free (open source) |
| **Bright Data** | Residential proxies | From $5/GB |
| **Scrapy** | Large-scale structured scraping | Free (open source) |
| **2Captcha** | CAPTCHA solving (last resort) | From $2.99/1000 |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using headless mode** — Many anti-bot systems detect headless browsers. Use headed mode with a virtual display if needed.
2. **Ignoring TLS fingerprints** — Your JA3 hash reveals the client. Real Chrome has a specific TLS fingerprint that libraries don't match.
3. **Same user-agent for all requests** — Rotate UAs, but keep them consistent within a session.
4. **Scraping logged-in pages without session management** — Cookies and auth tokens need careful handling.
5. **Not respecting `robots.txt`** — It won't block you technically, but it can have legal implications.

## Legal Considerations
