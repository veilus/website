Every anti-detect browser on the market is built with Electron. We chose a different path — and the numbers show why.

## The Problem with Electron

Electron is a framework that bundles Chromium and Node.js together, letting developers build desktop apps with web technologies. It's how VS Code, Slack, Discord, and virtually every anti-detect browser is built.

For most apps, Electron is fine. For an anti-detect browser, it's a fundamental architectural mistake.

Here's why: **an anti-detect browser's core job is to run Chromium instances.** Electron itself *is* a Chromium instance. So when you launch a profile in an Electron-based anti-detect browser, you're running Chromium inside Chromium.

```
[Electron Shell (Chromium + Node.js)]
  └── [Anti-detect UI]
       └── [Profile 1: Chromium instance]
       └── [Profile 2: Chromium instance]
       └── [Profile 3: Chromium instance]
```

Each layer adds overhead — memory, CPU, startup time.

## Our Architecture: Tauri + Rust

Veilus uses **Tauri**, a framework that replaces Electron's Chromium shell with the operating system's native webview (for the UI only), and uses **Rust** for all backend logic.

```
[Tauri Shell (Native webview — lightweight)]
  └── [Rust Backend (memory-safe, compiled)]
       └── [Profile 1: Patched Chromium]
       └── [Profile 2: Patched Chromium]
       └── [Profile 3: Patched Chromium]
```

The UI shell is ~15MB instead of ~150MB. The Rust backend handles profile management, fingerprint generation, proxy routing, and automation scheduling — all compiled to native machine code.

## The Numbers

We benchmarked Veilus against two popular Electron-based anti-detect browsers on identical hardware (MacBook Pro M2, 16GB RAM):

### Application Startup

| Metric | Veilus (Tauri) | Competitor A (Electron) | Competitor B (Electron) |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Cold start | 1.5s | 4.2s | 3.8s |
| App bundle size | 28MB | 210MB | 185MB |
| Idle RAM (no profiles) | 45MB | 180MB | 160MB |

### Per-Profile Resource Usage

| Profiles Open | Veilus RAM | Electron RAM | Delta |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | 165MB | 380MB | -57% |
| 5 | 520MB | 1.4GB | -63% |
| 10 | 1.0GB | 2.8GB | -64% |
| 20 | 1.9GB | 5.2GB | -63% |
| 50 | 4.5GB | OOM* | — |

*\*Out of Memory on 16GB system — Electron-based browsers couldn't maintain 50 simultaneous profiles.*

### Why This Matters

- **More profiles on the same hardware.** If you manage 50+ accounts, you'd need 32GB+ RAM with Electron browsers. With Veilus, 16GB is enough.
- **Faster profile switching.** Less memory pressure means less swapping, which means faster everything.
- **Lower electricity costs.** Sounds trivial, but if you run profiles 24/7 for automation, CPU efficiency adds up.

## Beyond Performance: Why Rust?

Performance was the initial motivation. But Rust gave us other advantages we didn't fully appreciate until later:

### Memory Safety Without Garbage Collection

Rust's ownership model prevents memory leaks, use-after-free bugs, and data races at compile time. For a browser tool that manages sensitive data (cookies, credentials, fingerprints), this is a security feature, not just a technical detail.

### Fearless Concurrency

Veilus runs automation scripts across multiple profiles simultaneously. Rust's type system guarantees thread safety at compile time — no race conditions, no deadlocks, no "it works on my machine" surprises.

### SQLite Integration

Profile data in Veilus is stored in a local SQLite database. Rust's `rusqlite` crate gives us direct, zero-overhead access to SQLite — no ORM abstraction layers, no connection pooling complexity. Queries that touch fingerprint data average **<1ms**.

### Binary Size

The entire Veilus Rust backend compiles to a single binary under 15MB. Combined with the Tauri shell, the total app download is 28MB. Compare this to 200MB+ for Electron apps.

## The Trade-offs

Being honest about the downsides:

1. **Smaller ecosystem.** Front-end libraries often target Electron first. We had to build more things from scratch.
2. **Steeper learning curve.** Finding Rust developers is harder (and more expensive) than finding JavaScript developers.
3. **Slower iteration speed.** Rust's compiler is strict. Changes that take 5 minutes in JavaScript can take 30 minutes in Rust. But the bugs those 30 minutes catch would have taken hours to debug in production.
4. **Platform-specific challenges.** Tauri relies on native webviews for the UI, which occasionally behave differently across operating systems. We test on Windows, macOS, and Linux to catch these.

## Was It Worth It?

Absolutely. Our users report:
- Running 3-5x more profiles on the same hardware
- Noticeably faster app startup and profile switching
- Zero memory-related crashes (a common complaint with Electron anti-detect browsers)

The anti-detect browser market has been stuck on Electron since 2015. We believe Rust + Tauri is the foundation for the next generation of browser tools — and Veilus is proving it.
