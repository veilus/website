Choosing an anti-detect browser in 2026 is harder than ever. There are dozens of options, all claiming to be "the best." We built Veilus because we weren't satisfied with any of them — but we'll try to be fair in this comparison and let you decide.

## The Contenders

| Browser | Founded | Engine | Technology |
|---------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Veilus** | 2025 | Chromium (patched) | Tauri (Rust) |
| **Multilogin** | 2015 | Mimic (Chromium) / Stealthfox (Firefox) | Electron |
| **GoLogin** | 2019 | Orbita (Chromium) | Electron |
| **AdsPower** | 2019 | SunBrowser (Chromium) | Electron |
| **Dolphin{anty}** | 2021 | Chromium | Electron |

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Veilus | Multilogin | GoLogin | AdsPower | Dolphin |
|---------|-------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|
| Real Chromium patches (C++) | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ UA only | ⚠️ Partial |
| Built-in automation | ✅ VeilusFlow | ❌ Separate | ❌ | ⚠️ Basic RPA | ❌ API only |
| Visual workflow builder | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ Basic | ❌ |
| AI agent integration | ✅ BYOK | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Encrypted profile sync | ✅ E2E | ✅ Cloud | ✅ Cloud | ✅ Cloud | ✅ Cloud |
| Self-hosted sync option | ✅ Git/Drive | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Team management | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| API access | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Mobile fingerprints | 🔜 Soon | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## Performance: The Elephant in the Room

Every competitor except Veilus is built on **Electron** — a framework that wraps Chromium in a Node.js process. This means:

- Each profile window runs a full Chromium instance **plus** a Node.js process
- Memory usage compounds quickly with multiple profiles
- Cold start times are noticeably slower

Veilus uses **Tauri with Rust**, which communicates directly with the Chromium engine without the Electron overhead.

### Benchmark Results

| Metric | Veilus | Multilogin | GoLogin |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Cold start (app) | ~1.5s | ~4.2s | ~3.8s |
| Profile launch | ~0.8s | ~2.1s | ~1.9s |
| RAM per profile | ~120MB | ~310MB | ~280MB |
| 10 profiles RAM | ~1.2GB | ~3.1GB | ~2.8GB |
| CPU idle (10 profiles) | 2-3% | 8-12% | 7-10% |

*Tested on: MacBook Pro M2, 16GB RAM, macOS 14.3*

**What this means in practice:** On a laptop with 16GB RAM, you can comfortably run 50+ Veilus profiles, but only 15-20 Multilogin profiles before swapping starts.

## Fingerprint Quality

We tested all browsers against [creepjs.com](https://creepjs.com) and [iphey.com](https://iphey.com):

| Test | Veilus | Multilogin | GoLogin | AdsPower |
|------|-------|-----------|---------|----------|
| CreepJS trust score | 85%+ | 80%+ | 65%+ | 45%+ |
| iphey.com result | ✅ Real | ✅ Real | ⚠️ Altered | ❌ Detected |
| Canvas fingerprint | Unique | Unique | Unique | Randomized |
| WebGL fingerprint | Consistent | Consistent | ⚠️ Noise | ❌ Noise |
| AudioContext | Patched | Patched | ⚠️ Default | ❌ Default |
| Font enumeration | Controlled | Controlled | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ System fonts |

**Key insight:** "Randomized" fingerprints are actually *worse* than consistent ones. A fingerprint that changes every time, or contains statistical noise, is a strong signal of spoofing. Real devices have consistent, predictable fingerprints.

## Pricing Comparison

| Plan | Veilus | Multilogin | GoLogin | AdsPower | Dolphin |
|------|-------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|
| Free | 5 profiles forever | 7-day trial | 7-day trial | 2 profiles | 10 profiles |
| Entry | $15/mo (30 profiles) | $99/mo (100) | $49/mo (100) | $9/mo (10) | $89/mo (100) |
| Pro | $49/mo (200 profiles) | $199/mo (300) | $99/mo (300) | $50/mo (100) | $159/mo (300) |
| Business | $99/mo (1000 profiles) | $399/mo (1000) | $199/mo (1000) | $100/mo (300) | $299/mo (1000) |
| Annual discount | 40% | 25% | 25% | 20% | 20% |

**Veilus is 2-4x cheaper** at every tier, primarily because our Rust architecture is cheaper to support (less server load, less bandwidth for leaner profile data).

## Automation: The Differentiator

This is where Veilus is genuinely unique. Other browsers treat automation as an afterthought — you need separate tools (Puppeteer, Selenium, custom scripts) to automate tasks.

**VeilusFlow** is built directly into the browser:

1. **Record mode** — Click "Record", perform actions manually, and VeilusFlow captures every step
2. **Visual canvas** — Drag and drop to build multi-step workflows with conditions and loops
3. **Code export** — Export to Playwright or Puppeteer scripts for advanced customization
4. **Scheduling** — Set automations to run on a cron schedule
5. **Batch execution** — Run the same automation across multiple profiles simultaneously

No other anti-detect browser offers this level of integrated automation.

## Who Should Use What?

| If you are... | We recommend |
|--------------|-------------|
| Budget-conscious, need automation | **Veilus** |
| Enterprise with existing Selenium workflows | **Multilogin** (mature API) |
| Just starting, need simplicity | **GoLogin** (simpler UI) |
| Running many accounts, tight budget | **AdsPower** (cheapest entry) |
| Developer who wants API-first | **Dolphin{anty}** |

## Our Honest Take

We built Veilus because we believe anti-detect browsers should be:

1. **Fast** — Electron is not the answer for a tool you run all day
2. **Affordable** — $99/mo for 100 profiles is too expensive for most users
3. **Complete** — Automation shouldn't require 3 separate tools
4. **Private** — Your profile data should be yours, not stored on someone else's cloud

We're newer than the competition, which means we're still building some features (mobile fingerprints, browser extensions). But our core — fingerprinting, performance, and automation — is already ahead.
